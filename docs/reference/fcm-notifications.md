# FCM Notifications

> **Status**: Production (Pure Push)
> **Last Updated**: February 2026
> **Scope**: Web (FCM), iOS/Android (Capacitor Firebase Messaging)

## Overview

Consent requests are delivered to users via **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** using a **pure push** architecture. The backend sends enriched FCM payloads containing all data needed to render consent toasts -- no frontend polling required.

**Supported platforms**: Web (FCM JS SDK), iOS (Capacitor Firebase Messaging), Android (Capacitor Firebase Messaging).

### Native iOS policy

Consent and connection requests are treated as **alert-class notifications** on iOS:

- the backend sends an explicit APNs alert payload for iOS tokens
- the payload carries a visible alert, sound, badge, routing metadata, and native action category
- the app still refreshes in-app state after receipt or tap
- Approve and Deny notification actions only open the app into a confirmation flow; they do not commit a decision directly from the notification

This is stricter than the web lane. Web remains service-worker/browser-notification based, while native iOS is expected to surface a system-visible alert when the device allows it.

### Reminder policy

Consent notifications now use a bounded two-step schedule:

- sequence `1`: initial request push
- sequence `2`: one final reminder near expiry

There is no midpoint reminder and no repeated reminder loop once a request has been attended or resolved.

### Architecture

```
1. MCP Agent → POST /api/v1/request-consent
2. Backend inserts consent_audit row
3. PostgreSQL pg_notify trigger fires
4. consent_listener.py receives event
5. Enriches FCM payload: { request_id, scope, agent_id, scope_description }
6. Sends FCM message to user's registered tokens
7. Client receives push → renders toast from payload data
8. No polling and no production SSE requirement for notification data
```

### Stale Token Handling

When Firebase returns `messaging.UnregisteredError` or `messaging.SenderIdMismatchError`, the listener automatically deletes the stale token from `user_push_tokens`.

### Token Lifecycle

| Event        | Action                                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Login        | Register token via `POST /api/notifications/register` |
| Token rotate | Native listener re-registers new token    |
| Logout       | Delete token via `DELETE /api/notifications/unregister` |

## FCM vs gcloud: What Can and Cannot Be Done

### Cannot be done with gcloud CLI alone

Consent push uses **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**. FCM is a **Firebase product** (part of Google Cloud). The following **cannot** be fully configured or operated from the **gcloud CLI** alone:

| Task | Why gcloud is not enough |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Web push (VAPID key)** | VAPID keys are created and managed in the **Firebase Console** (Project Settings → Cloud Messaging → Web Push certificates). There is no gcloud command to create or list VAPID keys. |
| **FCM project configuration** | Enabling Cloud Messaging, linking to a Firebase project, and client configuration (sender ID, app ID) are done in the **Firebase Console**. |
| **Client registration** | The web app uses the **Firebase JS SDK** (`getToken`, `onMessage`). Token registration and foreground handling are implemented in code, not via gcloud. |
| **Sending messages in production** | The backend uses the **Firebase Admin SDK** (with `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_JSON`) to send FCM messages. There is no first-class `gcloud messaging send` command. |

So: **consent push cannot be driven “directly using the gcloud CLI”** as a single tool. You need Firebase Console for setup and the application (backend + frontend) for sending and receiving.

### What gcloud CLI is used for

gcloud is used for **GCP resources** that support the FCM-based flow:

| Task | gcloud usage |
|------|--------------|
| **Enable APIs** | `gcloud services enable fcm.googleapis.com` (optional; Firebase/Cloud Messaging may already be enabled with Firebase). |
| **Store service account secret** | Store `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_JSON` in Secret Manager so the backend can send FCM: `gcloud secrets create FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_JSON --data-file=sa.json` (see [env-vars.md](./env-vars.md)). |
| **Deploy backend/frontend** | Deploy consent-protocol to Cloud Run via `gcloud run deploy` (see [Deployment](#deployment) in the root README). |
| **Get an OAuth token for FCM HTTP v1 (testing)** | You can obtain an access token (e.g. Application Default Credentials after `gcloud auth application-default login`) and send a **test** message via the FCM HTTP v1 API with `curl`. This does not replace the Firebase Console or the app for normal operation. |

## Architecture (short)

1. **consent_audit** row inserted → Postgres trigger **NOTIFY consent_audit_new**.
2. **Notification worker** (in consent-protocol) **LISTEN**s; on NOTIFY it:
   - Sends FCM to the user’s registered tokens (Firebase Admin SDK),
   - Pushes the event into a per-user in-app queue for SSE.
3. **Web client**: Requests permission, gets FCM token (`getToken` with VAPID key), registers token via `POST /api/notifications/register`; handles **onMessage** (foreground) and **notificationclick** (service worker) to open `/consents?tab=pending`.

See the plan in `.cursor/plans/` and [consent-protocol.md](./consent-protocol.md) for full flow.

## Event pipeline (trigger → listener → queue → SSE / FCM)

Consent requests reach the user only when the following chain is in place:

1. **Trigger** – When a row is inserted into `consent_audit`, a Postgres trigger runs and sends **NOTIFY consent_audit_new** with a JSON payload (user_id, request_id, action, etc.). The trigger is defined in `db/migrations/011_consent_audit_notify_trigger.sql` and in `consent-protocol/db/legacy/init_supabase_schema.sql`. **The trigger must be applied to the same database the app uses at runtime** (the one pointed to by `DB_HOST` / `DB_NAME`). If the trigger is missing on that database, NOTIFY never fires and neither FCM nor in-app SSE will receive consent events.

2. **Listener** – The consent-protocol backend starts a background task that **LISTEN**s to `consent_audit_new` on an asyncpg connection to the same DB. When NOTIFY is received, it (a) optionally pushes the event into a per-user queue for non-production SSE debugging, and (b) calls the FCM path to send push to the user’s registered tokens. If the DB pool is unavailable at startup (e.g. missing `DB_*` env), the listener does not start and no NOTIFY is ever handled; check logs for `Consent listener: DB pool not available` and (in development only) verify `GET /debug/consent-listener` shows `listener_active: true` after startup.

3. **Queue → SSE fallback** – The in-app SSE generator creates a queue per user when the first SSE connection for that user is opened. Local development and UAT are expected to keep `CONSENT_SSE_ENABLED=true` so web fallback delivery can be validated when FCM is blocked or misconfigured. Production stays FCM-first by default with `CONSENT_SSE_ENABLED=false`, and `/api/consent/events/{user_id}/poll/{request_id}` remains hard-disabled there.

4. **UI** – The frontend (ConsentSSEProvider, ConsentNotificationProvider) subscribes to SSE and shows toasts / refreshes the pending list when it receives a consent event.

**Diagnostic:** In development, call `GET /debug/consent-listener` to see `listener_active`, `queue_count`, and `notify_received_count`. In production this endpoint is intentionally unavailable (`404`), so use backend logs/metrics instead. If `notify_received_count` never increases after creating a consent request, NOTIFY is not reaching the process (trigger not on runtime DB or listener not running). If it increases but users see no push, the issue is downstream (no tokens, Firebase not configured, or send failure; check backend logs for "FCM skipped" or "FCM send failed").

---

## Required setup (Firebase Console + env)

1. **Firebase Console**  
   - Same Firebase project as auth.  
   - **Cloud Messaging**: Ensure Cloud Messaging is enabled.  
   - **Web Push**: Under Project Settings → Cloud Messaging → “Web configuration”, generate a **Key pair** (VAPID key). Use the **Key pair** value as `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY` in the frontend.
   - **Environment model**: If the app uses one Firebase identity plane across dev/UAT/prod and only the databases differ, keep the same Firebase project/web config aligned across those environments. Do not point auth at one Firebase project and web messaging at another.

2. **Backend**  
   - **FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_JSON**: Service account JSON (Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service accounts → Generate new private key). Stored in GCP Secret Manager and injected into consent-protocol (see [env-vars.md](./env-vars.md)).

3. **Frontend**  
   - **NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY**: VAPID key from step 1. Without it, web FCM token registration is skipped (see [env-vars.md](./env-vars.md)).

4. **gcloud**  
   - Create/update secret:  
     `gcloud secrets create FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_JSON --data-file=path/to/sa.json`  
     (or use Secret Manager in Cloud Console.)  
   - Deploy backend so it has access to this secret (e.g. Cloud Run with `--set-secrets`).

## Web fallback delivery

Web consent delivery now uses two lanes:

1. **Primary**: Browser FCM push
2. **Fallback**: Authenticated SSE + inbox while the tab is open

The client exposes these delivery states:

| State | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `push_active` | Browser FCM is healthy and token registration succeeded. |
| `push_blocked` | Browser permission is blocked, so the app falls back to live SSE alerts while the tab is open. |
| `push_failed_fallback_active` | Push registration failed or is misconfigured, but SSE fallback is active. |
| `inbox_only` | Neither push nor live SSE is currently active. Requests still appear in the consent center on next load. |

If web push fails, the app:

- clears stale browser push subscriptions,
- clears cached Firebase web push IndexedDB state,
- retries the SDK path,
- attempts a manual FCM registration path,
- then activates authenticated SSE fallback if push still fails.

Closed-tab behavior remains limited by browser push availability: if push is disabled or misconfigured and the tab is closed, the durable fallback is the consent inbox on next app open.

---

## Operator runbook for web push failures

When web consent notifications fail:

1. Confirm browser permission is allowed for the active origin.
2. Open the consent center and check the reported delivery mode.
3. Use `Retry push registration` in the consent center after any config changes.
4. Verify a successful registration creates a row in `user_push_tokens`.
5. In Firebase Console, open the active project:
   - **Project Settings → Cloud Messaging → Web configuration**
   - confirm the Web Push key pair matches the Firebase project used for login and token verification
   - update `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY` to the public key from that same project
6. If the browser still returns `401 Unauthorized` from `fcmregistrations.googleapis.com`, first check for a Firebase project mismatch between auth verification and web messaging before assuming the VAPID key itself is wrong.

Remember:

- `gcloud` can enable APIs and manage secrets.
- `gcloud` cannot create or rotate the Firebase Console Web Push key pair.
- A healthy fallback path on web is **SSE + inbox**, not repeated FCM retry loops.

## Native iOS alert checklist

Use this when Firebase accepts an iOS send but the device does not visibly alert:

1. Confirm the token row exists in `user_push_tokens` with `platform='ios'`.
2. Confirm the send returned a Firebase `message_id` instead of `THIRD_PARTY_AUTH_ERROR`.
3. On the device, verify the Hushh app has:
   - `Allow Notifications`
   - `Notification Center`
   - `Lock Screen`
   - `Banners`
   - `Sounds`
4. Confirm Focus / Do Not Disturb is off.
5. Background the app before testing.
6. Check native logs for:
   - APNs token registration
   - FCM token refresh
   - foreground receipt
   - notification tap callback

If the backend accepted the send and the app still does not present anything, debug the device presentation path before changing Firebase or the sender again.

## Sending a test message (gcloud + curl, optional)

If you want to **test** FCM delivery without the full app flow, you can use an OAuth token and the FCM HTTP v1 API. This still requires a valid **device token** (from the app or from a test registration) and does **not** replace Firebase Console for configuration.

1. **Get an access token** (Application Default Credentials; requires `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase.messaging` or `cloud-platform`):

   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
   export FCM_TOKEN=$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)
   ```

2. **Send one message** (replace `PROJECT_ID` and `DEVICE_REGISTRATION_TOKEN`):

   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $FCM_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "message": {
         "token": "DEVICE_REGISTRATION_TOKEN",
         "data": { "type": "consent_request", "request_id": "test-123" },
         "notification": {
           "title": "Consent request",
           "body": "Test from gcloud + curl"
         }
       }
     }' \
     "https://fcm.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/messages:send"
   ```

The **device registration token** must come from the client (web app’s `getToken()` or a mobile app). There is no gcloud command to generate or list device tokens; they are created by the Firebase client SDKs when the app runs.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Can consent push be done **directly with gcloud CLI**? | **No.** FCM requires Firebase Console (VAPID, project/config) and application code (Firebase Admin SDK + client SDK) for production. |
| What **is** gcloud used for? | Enabling APIs, storing `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_JSON` in Secret Manager, deploying services. Optionally getting an OAuth token to send a **test** message via FCM HTTP v1 with `curl`. |
| Where is the VAPID key set? | **Firebase Console** → Project Settings → Cloud Messaging → Web configuration → Key pair. Set in frontend as `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY`. |
| Where is the service account JSON set? | **Firebase Console** → Project Settings → Service accounts → Generate key. Store in **GCP Secret Manager** and inject into the backend (see [env-vars.md](./env-vars.md)). |
